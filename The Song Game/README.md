# What is it ?
The Song game is a platformer powered by the music files you can input into the program. Itâ€™s a P5JS based program with the additional libraries, P5.dom, P5.play and P5.sound. With all these elements together, you can input any music file (MP3, WAV or FLAC) and play a level that reacts to the elements of the songs. We've seperated the core javascript files so you can use the sound engine for any other projects!
