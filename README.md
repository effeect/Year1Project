# The song game
Welcome to the offical GitHub page for the song game, a game which showcases the power of what music can do when mixed in with p5 art plus a game. Both elements can be reused and implemented under the Creative Commons 4.0 License. You can read more about the conditions here : https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/

# What is it ?
The Song game is a platformer powered by the music files you can input into the program. Itâ€™s a P5JS based program with the additional libraries, P5.dom, P5.play and P5.sound. With all these elements together, you can input any music file (MP3, WAV or FLAC) and play a level that reacts to the elements of the songs. We've seperated the core javascript files so you can use the sound engine for any other projects!

If you want to know more, please read our Wiki on Github!

# BEFORE YOU PLAY
As of **10/05/2018**, Google chrome seems to have introduce a new security feature that has caused an issue where the music will refuse to play, the error will look something like [this in console.log](https://i.imgur.com/GgYMwCT.png). This can be fixed by a simple refresh however we **highly** recommend using an alternative browser, Microsoft Edge does not have this feature yet. We will be updating the program in the future to fix this issue however we have been struggling to find a solution.

If you don't have a windows pc, you can use something like Mozilla Firefox which does not have this security problem.
