# Year1Project

This is our Year 1 Creative Project Git. This repository contains all of the code for our p5js based platformer which has a focus on sound design.

//What is it?//
We are proposing to make a JavaScript-based video game that revolves around the user inputting an MP3 file of their choice and the levels, enemies and elements of the game react to the music. So all of the timings and other mechanics revolve around the music inside the game.
The map, the enemies, obstacles will be generated based on sound levels, bass and other musical elements. It could include certain music elements helping the user while others increasing difficulty. It might include challenges like speeding up the audio or tuning which would result in unique and strange enemies. This could make replay value enormous since each MP3 file will bring something new to the table.
Elements wise, it would mainly require graphics elements but the sound design is also a major element, what we are planning to do doesn’t necessarily fit into the terms of generative sound but some of the elements may be considered that way by people.
In terms of what the platformer would be like, we’ve chosen to be a little similar to Super Mario Bros, this is because the slow pacing of this style of game will be able to highlight the sound design. Some other platformers such as Sonic the Hedgehog or Mega Man would be too fast-paced for a game like this. We have chosen to do a 2D based platformer to save time and focus more on the sound elements as we mentioned since the levels and mechanics of the game revolve around it.
As you would progress through the level, the MP3 file in question would be playing in the background, this will allow the user to not only enjoy their music but it will be a game element and the world around them will react as the song continues so choosing when to strike.
In terms of technical aspects, we would be measuring sound levels by using a JavaScript library called maximJs, this will allow us to measure the sound levels and other elements of the song input into the game. The library will also allow us to manipulate the music
